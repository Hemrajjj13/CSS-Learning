# CSS-Learning

This repository contains my learning journey with **Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)**.  
It includes lessons, practice projects, and examples that cover core concepts of CSS, such as:

- CSS selectors and properties  
- Colors, backgrounds, and gradients  
- Fonts, text, and typography  
- Box model, margins, padding, and borders  
- Flexbox and Grid layout systems  
- Positioning and z-index  
- Responsive design with media queries  
- Animations and transitions  

Each lesson builds on the previous one, making it easier to understand CSS in a structured way.  
This repo can be helpful for **beginners** who want to learn CSS through practical examples.
